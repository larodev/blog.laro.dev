Learn about:

- the basic technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), 
- the languages around (PHP, Python, Go) frameworks (React, Ember, Svelte) 
- and available tools (WordPress, Netlify, GitHub)
- SEO

For the basic training I rely on:

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

As exercises I can:

- Check the website of a business and propose an alternative.
